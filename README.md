# Dune-website
In this web development tutorial we will create a responsive Website suing HTML5 CSS3 and Sass/Scss in order to create a clone of the Dune novels website. I will use sass and scss in this project in order to take advantage of sass nesting properties and partials.

Nesting will help us write 10X quicker CSS and it is also extremely helpful when creating utility classes.
